# Technical proof of concept documentation

1. Write a one page note about the topics with highlights of what you have
   learned about Cucumber and Profiling and can be used in the Gutenberg project
1. Also hand-in code used for your experiments, including data files for
   pairwise testing. If you have used TestPairs, then hand-in

– xml file with input data
– cvs file with test data

# SPIKE: Technical proof of concept work

1. Examine Cucumber: Set up small Cucumber project with Feature, Scenario(s)
   and step definitions.
   a) Make sure your project has a number of input values that need to be
      tested in combination.

2. Use pairwise testing technique to create a reduced number of test cases
   based on a combination of criteria for project above
   a) You might want to use tool to generate pairwise or tree wise combinations

3. Examine JMeter: Profile an application

1. Methods, objects, telemetry (CPU, memory, threads etc.), SQL queries etc.
