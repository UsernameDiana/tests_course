# Project 1

### "Testing Real Life Code"

* Explain the purpose of the Test (what the original test exposed, and what your test exposes)
* Explain about Parameterized Tests in JUnit and how you have used it in this exercise.
* Explain the topic Data Driven Testing, and why it often makes a lot of sense to read test data from a
file.
* Your answers to the question; whether what you implemented was a Unit Test or a JUnit Test, the
problems you might have discovered with the test and, your suggestions for ways this could have
been fixed.
* The steps you took to include Hamcrest matchers in the project, and the difference they made for
the test
