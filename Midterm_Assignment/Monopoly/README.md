# Project 3

### Monopoly

* Explain your solution with focus on its design.
    * Does it have:
        * low coupling,
        * interfaces,
        * polymorphism,
        * Inversion of Control and Dependency injection as central design principles
    * If not, why? Otherwise, demonstrate it!

* Explain your test case design activity and argument for the choices that you have made:
    * how to choose the right test conditions (i.e. what to test which in principle will be all code when you
are a TDD’er)?  
    * what test design techniques to use (both consider black-box techniques and white-box technique)?
    * how much effort to put into each test condition (how critical is the item will influence it’s test
coverage percentage)?
