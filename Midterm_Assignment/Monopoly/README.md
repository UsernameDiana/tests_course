# Project 3

### Monopoly

* Explain your solution with focus on its design.
    * Does it have:
        * low coupling,
        * interfaces,
        * polymorphism,
        * Inversion of Control and Dependency injection as central design principles
    * If not, why? Otherwise, demonstrate it!

* Explain your test case design activity and argument for the choices that you have made:
    * How to choose the right test conditions (what to test; which will be all code,
      when you are a TDD’er)?
    * What test design techniques to use (both consider black-box and white-box technique)?
    * How much effort to put into each test condition (how critical is the item,
      will it influence it’s test coverage percentage)?
